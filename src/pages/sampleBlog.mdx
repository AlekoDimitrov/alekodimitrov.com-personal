  is a fast, reliable, and memory-efficient programming language. It's been
  voted the most loved programming language six years in a row (survey). Created
  by Mozilla, it's now used at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google
  for systems infrastructure, encryption, virtualization, and more low-level
  programming.
  <br />
  Why is Rust now being used to replace parts of the JavaScript web ecosystem
  like minification (Terser), transpilation (Babel), formatting (Prettier),
  bundling (webpack), linting (ESLint), and more?
