          My web journey began in 2017 when I was still figuring out what
          digital skills I wanted to focus on. I was learning web development on
          and off for a couple of years. By the end of 2021, I had found my love
          for solving problems. The older I got, the more I understood how
          valuable a good software developer is, and so I began to head in that
          direction. Now I&apos;m somewhere on the path, and I don&apos;t think
          I&apos;ll ever turn back. <br /> <br />
          My dream is to reach the pinnacle of every skill required to be an
          indispensable part of a team.

            . Most of the time, I use JavaScript, but depending on the mood, I
            might throw in some Python. JS is the language I enjoy tinkering
            with, but sometimes it bothers me for being the #1 reason causing a
            slower web. That is also why I&apos;d love to work on improving
            efficiency within my code. There is a lot of bloat JS code running
            behind the scenes on many websites, making them heavy and causing
            bad UX.

            Aside from coding, I enjoy learning and growing my skilset through
            active engagement (hence the blog). I read, write and do everything
            that makes me more proficient in a given field. I like to believe
            that through mastery, a person can best achieve what&apos;s both
            great and worth sharing.
