          My web journey began in 2017 when I was still figuring out what
          digital skills I wanted to focus on. I was learning web development on
          and off for a couple of years and by the end of 2021, I had found my love
          for solving web problems. The more I learned, the more I understood how
          valuable a good software developer is. Now, my goal is to become one.

            . Most of the time, I use JavaScript, but depending on what I&apos;m trying
            to learn, I migh use other languages. I chose JavaScript because I&apos;m
            bothered that this is the #1 reason causing a bloated web.
            That is also why I&apos;d love to work on improving
            efficiency within my own code. There are lots of inefficiencies caused by JS,
            making websites run slower, resulting in bad UX.

            Aside from coding, I enjoy learning and growing my skilset through
            active engagement with community and colleagues. I like to believe
            that through mastery, a person can best achieve what&apos;s both
            great and worth sharing.
