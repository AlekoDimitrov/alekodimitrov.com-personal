          My web development journey began in 2017 when I had to figure out what
          I was gonna do for a living. I did it on and off for a couple of
          years. By the end of 2021, I had developed my love for solving
          problems. The more I grew, the better I understood how valuable a good
          software developer is. Now I&apos;m here, creating things and having
          fun. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever turn back. <br /> <br /> My
          dream is to reach the peak of every necessary skill required to be an
          indispensable part of every tech team.

            My interests are within the JavaScript + TypeScript ecosystem. I
            love to work with React and Next.js.

          <Typography variant="body2" mt={2}>
            I always strive to write clean, functional code and inefficiencies
            are never overlooked.

            Aside from coding, I enjoy learning and growing my skills through
            active engagement. I read, write and do everything that leads me
            closer to proficiency. I believe that only through mastery of crafts
            can a person ever achieve anything worth sharing.
